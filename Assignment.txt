Creating an application to manage interaction between 3 collection and CRUD over the same.

1. There will be 3 collection, Users, Business and Products.

User { name, email, bio, profilePic }
Business { name, email, registrationNo }
Products { name, mrp, description, image[2] }

So purpose is to see how good you are while managing multiple collections.
You have to create following APIs

1. Create User
2. User can have multiple business
3. User can post product as an individual or through his business

C - create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete

Functionalities for different collection

1. User - C, R
2. Business - C, R
3. Products - C, R, U, D

All the fields mentioned above shall be there, apart from this do add all the fields you feel are important for referencing 3 collections

Indexing is required for all three collections.

Once done with the assignment - 

1. Push code on Github
2. If possible deploy code over Heroku or any free medium
3. Postman documentation for all the APIs
4. Proper documented code.
